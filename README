What it is:
CoolMad's Cobblemon is a clientside modpack designed with optimization and QoL in mind.
It has 2 versions, Advanced and Basic (Also referred to as A and B), with Advanced implementing new features, upgrading existing ones, and having more QoL. 
Basic, on the other hand, is based around performance with minimal QoL, for weak PCs or stricter servers where not much is allowed.
This modpack, as the name states, is based on Cobblemon, and so that mod is required on the server.
Also note that this modpack is CLIENTSIDE-ONLY, and cannot be installed serverside. It will do little to nothing.

Installation:
If using the default Minecraft launcher, manually build the pack using the files in this Github. Note that I will leave this on outdated versions.
However, I suggest using a mod launcher such as Prism Launcher, which can allow you to automatically download from the Modrinth and Curseforge.

For mod launchers:
Open the launcher.
Either use the built-in downloader and type "cm cobble" or "coolmad's cobblemon" or go to the Modrinth/Curseforge page, download the file, and import it into the launcher.
Press play. Enjoy.

Which location to download from:
Preferrably, Modrinth. This is because Curseforge removes several mods, and the Github earns me nothing.
As well as Modrinth just generally being the best option for these kind of things, unless it isn't hosted there.
